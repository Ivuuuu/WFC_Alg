# WFC_Alg
## **Purpose:**
Made January-March 2022. The purpose of this project was to create a simple game that procedurally generated levels based off the wave function collapse algorithm. Levels will automatically place tiles, rippling out, that further constrain and collapse neighboring tile possibilities. 

## **Controls:**
- Movement: WASD/Arrow Keys
- Confirm: Enter
- Pause: Escape

## **Instructions for Unity:**
1. Clone repo
2. Open Unity Hub
3. Select open
4. Select the Unity project folder in the directory of the clone
5. The project will be added to Unity hub
6. Select the project to open it (The project was last run in Unity version 2021.1.15f1)

Gif showing the basic gameplay. The player avoids enemies while trying to collect the coins necessary to open a door. <br/>

When the player has collected all coins, they may exit. The next generated level then has additional coin requirements, more enemies, and more coins generated to make it progressively harder. <br/>

If the player comes into contact with an enemy, they will splat. <br/>
